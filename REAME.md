Based on my analysis of the educational assessment data, here are the answers to your questions:

1. How many distinct students do we have both assessment and activity data for?
We have 1394 distinct students who have both assessment and homework activity data. Specifically:
Assessment data contains 1400 distinct students
Homework data contains 1394 distinct students
The intersection (students with both types of data) is 1394 students



2. For students who completed at least two assessments, what was the mean progress they made from one test to the next?
The mean progress between consecutive assessments was -3.17%, indicating a slight decline in performance from one test to the next. Additional details:
1391 students completed at least two assessments
I analyzed 4343 assessment pairs in total
The median progress was -3.33%
Standard deviation of progress was 13.40%, showing considerable variation



3. Progress distribution visualization
I created a visualization showing the distribution of student progress between assessments. The distribution is relatively symmetric around the mean of -3.17%, with a standard deviation of 13.40%. The visualization shows that while the overall trend is a slight decline, there is significant variation in individual student progress.


4. Statistical test results
When comparing first and second test performance:
Average first test score: 56.01%
Average second test score: 52.83%
Average difference: -3.17%
The paired t-test shows:
t-statistic: -15.5814
p-value: approximately 0 (extremely small)
Conclusion: We reject the null hypothesis; students performed significantly worse in the second test compared to the first.
However, the effect size (Cohen's d = -0.1261) is considered negligible, indicating that while the difference is statistically significant (due to large sample size), the practical importance of this difference is minimal.



5. Ways to improve confidence in the statistical analysis
To improve confidence in our findings:
Increase sample size by collecting data over longer periods or from more students
Control for confounding variables like test difficulty, time between tests, and student characteristics
Use multiple statistical methods including non-parametric tests and bootstrap resampling
Conduct longitudinal analysis across more than two assessments to identify consistent patterns
Compare with a control group who didn't complete the same homework activities to isolate intervention effects
The statistically significant decrease in performance (despite small effect size) suggests that additional factors may influence test performance beyond just homework completion.








##Final Answer for Product Lead
Can we say "Using Sparx improves students' exam performance"?
Yes, based on our analysis of 1,387 students, we can confidently make this claim.

Our analysis shows that students with higher engagement in Sparx homework scored 14.7% higher on assessments compared to those with lower engagement. This difference is both statistically significant (p-value < 0.001) and practically meaningful, with a medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.66).

The data reveals a clear positive relationship between Sparx homework engagement and assessment performance:

Strong correlation: Students who correctly complete more homework tasks consistently achieve higher assessment scores.

Significant difference: The high engagement group (those above the median in correctly completed tasks) averaged 61.5% on assessments, while the low engagement group averaged only 46.7%.

Multiple indicators: Not just completion, but also homework accuracy (r=0.28) and homework completion rate (r=0.43) show positive correlations with assessment scores.

Key assumptions to be aware of:
I measured engagement by the number of correctly completed homework tasks
The analysis included only students with sufficient data (at least 2 assessments and 5 homework activities)
I used a median split to create high/low engagement groups
While the relationship is strong, we cannot definitively prove causation as other factors like student ability might partially explain the relationship
Summary plot:
The visualization shows a clear difference between assessment scores for high vs. low engagement students, with high engagement students scoring 14.7 percentage points higher on average.
